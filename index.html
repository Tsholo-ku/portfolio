                <h2>Pyhton Developer/Java Developer/Cloud Practioner</h2>
                <p>I am a self taught Junior Software Developer based in Johannesburg, Gauteng. I am passionate about back-end development and I love to collaborate with others. I have always been fascinated by the behind-the-scenes of software, and I enjoy solving and fixing problems in this area.</p>
                <p>My journey to become a Software Developer began when I won a one month Web Development course. Since then, I never stopped seeking other courses to further this new found love. I have since learned more Python libraries, HTML, CSS, testing, writing documentation, creating APIs, Django, obtained a AWS Cloud Practioner Certification and so much more. So far, I have 2 years experience in Python Development (including 1 year of learning) and I have managed to complete a 13 month internship at Xgile IT as a Junior Python Developer, which has given me a deep understanding of Software Development.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading and completing crossword puzzles. I also like to attend meet-ups to meet other like-minded developers, and I am always looking for new ways to grow and expand my career network.</p>
                <p>If you would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to download my resume or e-mail me at: <strong>kumalotsholo@gmail.com</strong></p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
